QuakeSphere is a mobile app developed for the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024 under the "Seismic Detection Across the Solar System" challenge. The app visualizes seismic activity across planets and moons in the solar system, offering users access to real-time earthquake data and insights.

The goal is to create a user-friendly interface that visualizes seismic data, fostering awareness about planetary geophysics, and assisting scientists in identifying patterns in seismic activities across different celestial bodies.

Features
🌍 Real-time Earthquake Data: Visualizes seismic data fetched from an API.
📊 Seismic Visualization: Displays earthquake trends through line charts and graphs.
🚀 Solar System Integration: Visualizes seismic data from Earth and other celestial bodies.
🛠️ Custom Filters: Filter data by magnitude, depth, time, and location.
🔄 Data Syncing: Syncs data automatically or manually with seismic APIs.
💡 AI Insights: (Optional) Provides predictive insights on seismic trends
